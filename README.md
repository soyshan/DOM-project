# DOM-project

This is a website for a fictitious app called Cookly.

## Description

In this project, I have created a landing page with an image carousel for my post section, and also a button for dark mode. When you click on the buttons, you can see the registration and login form, which includes form validations. Additionally, there is a final page indicating that you have completed the form, with a button to download the fictitious app.

I have to made the blog section and also a form to confirm that the user want to suscribe to the newsletter, but mainly the idea is that, with same colours and style.
