# DOM-project
This a website for a fictitious app called Cookly.

In this project I create a landing page with an image carousel for my section of the post, and also a button for dark mode.
When you click on the buttons you can see the form of register and login, which was made with validations in the form.
And finally you have a final page, where itÂ´s just indicate that you have complete the form and there is a button to download the fictitious app.

I have to made the blog section and also a form to confirm that the user want to suscribe to the newsletter, but mainly the idea is that, with same colours and style.
